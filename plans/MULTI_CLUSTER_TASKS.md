# Multi-Cluster Support Implementation

## Status: Completed

## Tasks:

- [x] Check if kube_config is stored in database (not implemented initially)
- [x] Create cluster model with kube_config storage
- [x] Update user model to include preferred_region
- [x] Create cluster management service
- [x] Add cluster endpoints for admin
- [ ] Update environment service to use selected cluster (future enhancement)
